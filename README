*****
USAGE


Usage: bibdb [-e encoding] [-p preamble] file
  -e    Specify the encoding used as in iconv(1).
        Defaults to iso-8859-1.
  -p    Add a preamble to the generated file.
        For example -p "<\!DOCTYPE bibliography PUBLIC \"-//OASIS/... >".
  file  If 'file' is a LaTeX generated .aux file or a LaTeX .tex file, only
        generate entries for those present in the LaTeX source.
        If 'file' is a DocBook .xml file, only generate entries for those
        present in the DocBook file.  It looks for .bib files in the directory
        holding 'file'.
        If 'file' is a BibTeX .bib file, generate entries for the entire
        bibliography file.

**********
KNOWN BUGS

- Does not replace '<' and '>' by the XML entities '&lt;' and '&gt;'.
- Replaces '~' in URIs as if they were insecable spaces.
- Loads of error messages if your BibTeX files use the @preamble or the @string
  constructs.
